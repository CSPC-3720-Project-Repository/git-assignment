My name is Kevin Blinn and I plan to become a Software Developer! 
I'm currently a student at Clemson University on the way to get a Computer Science Degree. 
My goal is to advance and work on innovative technologies. 
I'm currently learning how to develop software using C++. 
I wish to be able to program in any language I try and I'm excited to work on projects that will help everyone!
